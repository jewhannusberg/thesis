This repository contains the scripts used to analyse the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecasts for electricity demand in NSW.

Initially a private repo, but I see no reason for it to remain private. It's essentially a student's first foray into data cleaning using Python. Hopefully it comes in handy for someone in the future :)
